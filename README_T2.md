# Task 2: Named Entity Recognition (NER)

https://absorbing-action-f33.notion.site/Classification-NER-Model-1e3094bc1d758025b726ce8554651b3b


### Setup instructions

#### Local Windows

1. Run the following in your terminal as an Administrator if you don't have LongPathsEnabled

```
New-ItemProperty -Path "HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\FileSystem" -Name "LongPathsEnabled" -Value 1 -PropertyType DWORD -Force
```

2. Run `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the notebook: `ner_v2.ipynb`


### Brief description of your approach

#### Data Analysis
Initial exploration revealed:
- 8 distinct symptoms and 8 dosage patterns in the training data
- Synthetic drug names (e.g., "DrugZ")
- Only single-word entities (simplifying IOB tagging)

#### Model Selection
After evaluating spaCy and transformer approaches, I adopted a biomedical-optimized architecture based on:

- DistilBERT base model for efficiency
- Custom token classification head for entity detection

The final implementation draws from established research in biomedical NER, particularly the [Raza et al. (2022)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9931203/) framework which demonstrated superior performance (F1 ~10% higher than ClinicalBERT) on similar tasks.

### Training and evaluation guide



#### Hyperparameter Tuning Strategy

Training Methodology
- Optimization: AdamW with learning rate 2e-5
- Batch Size: 16 (balanced memory/performance)
- Regularization: Weight decay (0.01)
- Early Stopping: Patience of 3 epochs (scrapped due to similar performance)

I adjusted parameters based on the training and validation loss graph. 
I read the paper [Large-scale application of named entity recognition to biomedicine and epidemiology (Raza 2022)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9931203/). It's trained on different data so I can't apply the same hyperparameters. It mentioned warmup steps that I ultimately decided against due to time constraints.

I tried early stopping because although there is a lot of data, it's a lot of the 'same' data, so it's similar to having 'limited data', which is what early stopping is good for. Thus, I tried early stopping to prevent overfitting. 

I increased epochs to 10 and set early stopping with patience 3. The results were similar to v2, so I opted for the [ner_v2](./ner_v2.ipynb) notebook instead.

#### Key Implementation Decisions

1. Data Augmentation: Expanded symptom/drug lexicons using LLM-generated examples
2. Entity Normalization: Replaced drug names with real drug names
3. Evaluation Protocol: Strict entity-level matching (precision/recall/F1)

#### Hyperparameter Configuration


**Training Arguments v2:**
```python
training_args = TrainingArguments(
    eval_strategy="epoch",
    learning_rate=2e-5,
    per_device_train_batch_size=16,
    per_device_eval_batch_size=16,
    num_train_epochs=3,
    weight_decay=0.01,
    save_strategy="epoch",
    load_best_model_at_end=True,
    metric_for_best_model="eval_loss",
    greater_is_better=False,
)
```

**Training Arguments v3 (early stopping, scrapped):**
```python
training_args = TrainingArguments(
    output_dir="/tmp/ner_results_v3",
    eval_strategy="steps",
    logging_strategy="steps",

    eval_steps=10, 
    logging_steps=10,

    learning_rate=2e-5,
    per_device_train_batch_size=16,
    per_device_eval_batch_size=16,
    num_train_epochs=10, # increase epochs since early stopping implemented
    weight_decay=0.01,
    logging_dir="/tmp/ner_logs",
    save_strategy="epoch",
    load_best_model_at_end=True,
    metric_for_best_model="eval_loss",
    greater_is_better=False,
)
```

**Legend:**
- ✓ = Correct prediction
- ✗ = Incorrect prediction
- ◯ = Missed opportunity




**Key findings**:

#### Strengths 
1. Dosage Recognition Excellence
- Perfect extraction of standard dosage formats (e.g., "75mg", "50mg/1000mg")
- Handles:
  - Frequency ("every 6h")
2. Symptom Identification
- Correctly captures:
  - Multi-word symptoms ("GI bleeding")
  - Symptom severity ("dry cough")
3. Drug Name Detection
  - Reliable identification of brand names ("Tylenol", "Multaq")
  - Handles chemical names ("CaCO3") despite punctuation challenges


#### Limitations 

1. Drug Entity Over-Identification
- False positives on:
  - Medical abbreviations misclassified as drugs ("BID" [Latin for "twice daily"])- Non-drug terms ("tinnitus" incorrectly tagged as DRUG)
  - Punctuation artifacts ("carbonate):" included in drug span)
2. Street Drug Recognition Gap
- Failed to identify 'Molly'
- Limited to formal drug names (dataset limitation)
3. Contextual Understanding
- Struggles with:
  - Negated phrases ("No ibuprofen use" still extracts "ibuprofen")
  - Parenthetical drug information (includes closing punctuation in spans)
4. Symptom Boundary Issues
- Splits multi-word symptoms ("GI" and "bleeding" as separate entities)
- Includes trailing punctuation in spans ("fever," with comma)

### Future Improvements

1. Architecture Enhancements

- Transition to BioClinicalBERT for improved biomedical understanding
- Implement span-based prediction for multi-word entities (B-DRUG I-DRUG)

2. Data Expansion
- Incorporate external biomedical corpora (e.g., MIMIC-III)
- Develop synthetic data generation pipeline
- Annotate multi-word entities (e.g., "mild headache")
- Add street drug aliases to training set
- Include examples with:
  - More parenthesis
  - Negation patterns
  - Non-symptom medical terms
